```

## Circle 4: Design (Strategy & Planning)

### Completion Criteria
- [ ] Design decisions justified
- [ ] Trade-offs considered and evaluated
- [ ] Alternatives analyzed
- [ ] Design patterns applied appropriately
- [ ] UX/experience considered

### Common Issues
- **P0**: No design rationale
- **P1**: Trade-offs not considered
- **P2**: Single design only (no alternatives)
- **P3**: Design patterns not applied

### Validation Prompts
```
- What are the key design decisions?
- What trade-offs were considered?
- Were alternatives evaluated?
- What design patterns were applied?
```

## Circle 5: Build (Harmony & Integration)

### Completion Criteria
- [ ] Implementation plan solid
- [ ] Build approach optimal
- [ ] Integration considered from start
- [ ] Build process efficient
- [ ] Components built to specification

### Common Issues
- **P0**: No build plan
- **P1**: Suboptimal build approach
- **P2**: Integration not considered
- **P3**: Build process inefficient

### Validation Prompts
```
- What is the implementation plan?
- Is the build approach optimal?
- How is integration handled?
- Are components built to spec?
```

## Circle 6: Validate (Elevation & Verification)

### Completion Criteria
- [ ] Quality checks defined
- [ ] Validation approach sound
- [ ] Testing comprehensive
- [ ] Edge cases considered
- [ ] Success verification clear

### Common Issues
- **P0**: No quality checks defined
- **P1**: Inadequate validation approach
- **P2**: Testing incomplete
- **P3**: Edge cases not considered

### Validation Prompts
```
- What quality checks are in place?
- How is validation approached?
- Is testing comprehensive?
- Were edge cases considered?
```

## Circle 7: Integrate (Transcendence & Unity)

### Completion Criteria
- [ ] All components integrated
- [ ] System unified properly
- [ ] Completion criteria met
- [ ] Final validation passed
- [ ] Documentation complete

### Common Issues
- **P0**: Components not integrated
- **P1**: Poor integration (disconnected system)
- **P2**: Completion criteria unclear
- **P3**: Documentation incomplete

### Validation Prompts
```
- Are all components integrated?
- Is the system unified?
- Were completion criteria met?
- Is documentation complete?
```

## Tool Rotation Compliance

### T→S→D Pattern Validation
- **Circles 1,3,5,7**: Sequential → Tractatus → Debug
- **Circles 2,4,6**: Tractatus → Sequential → Debug

### Checklist
- [ ] Correct rotation pattern used
- [ ] All three thinking tools utilized
- [ ] Tools used in proper sequence
- [ ] Session IDs documented

## Overall Compliance Score

Calculate compliance as:
```
Score = (Circles Complete × 14) + (Tool Rotation × 7)
Max Score = 105 (7 circles × 14 + tool rotation × 7)
```

**Passing Score**: 80+ (76% compliance)
