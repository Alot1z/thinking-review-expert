# Depth & Quality Checklist

## Purpose
Validate the depth, quality, and cognitive value of thinking outputs.

## Depth Metrics

### Thought Cycle Count
**Target**: 8+ thoughts per circle (minimum 5)

| Circle | Min | Target | Excellence | P0 | P1 | P2 |
|--------|-----|--------|------------|----|----|----|
| Vision | 5 | 8+ | 12+ | <3 | 3-4 | 5-7 |
| Research | 8 | 12+ | 20+ | <5 | 5-7 | 8-11 |
| Structure | 5 | 8+ | 12+ | <3 | 3-4 | 5-7 |
| Design | 8 | 12+ | 20+ | <5 | 5-7 | 8-11 |
| Build | 5 | 8+ | 12+ | <3 | 3-4 | 5-7 |
| Validate | 5 | 8+ | 12+ | <3 | 3-4 | 5-7 |
| Integrate | 5 | 8+ | 12+ | <3 | 3-4 | 5-7 |

### Cognitive Depth Indicators
- [ ] Surface vs Deep analysis
- [ ] Obvious vs Non-obvious insights
- [ ] First-order vs Multi-order thinking
- [ ] Descriptive vs Generative output
- [ ] Reactive vs Proactive reasoning

### Quality Assessment

#### Insight Quality (P0-P3)
- **P0**: No insights (restatement of input)
- **P1**: Obvious insights (already known)
- **P2**: Good insights (some value added)
- **P3**: Excellent insights (novel, valuable)

#### Analysis Depth (P0-P3)
- **P0**: Superficial (surface level only)
- **P1**: Shallow (some depth but incomplete)
- **P2**: Good depth (comprehensive analysis)
- **P3**: Excellent depth (multi-layered, nuanced)

#### Justification Quality (P0-P3)
- **P0**: Unjustified claims (no support)
- **P1**: Weak justification (anecdotal only)
- **P2**: Good justification (evidence-based)
- **P3**: Strong justification (rigorous, multi-source)

## Quality Scoring Rubric

### Overall Quality Calculation
```
Quality Score = (Circle Scores Average × 0.6) + (Insight Quality × 0.2) + (Analysis Depth × 0.2)

Minimum Passing: 80/100
Excellent: 90+ /100
```

### Quality Categories

| Score Range | Quality Label | Description |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| 95-100 | Exceptional | Novel insights, rigorous analysis |
| 90-94 | Excellent | Strong insights, thorough analysis |
| 85-89 | Very Good | Good insights, solid analysis |
| 80-84 | Good | Adequate insights, sufficient analysis |
| 70-79 | Acceptable | Some insights, basic analysis |
| 60-69 | Needs Work | Minimal insights, shallow analysis |
| <60 | Poor | No insights, superficial analysis |

## Enhancement Opportunities

### Depth Enhancement
- "Go deeper on point X"
- "Consider implications of Y"
- "Analyze from perspective Z"
- "What are second-order effects?"

### Quality Enhancement
- "Provide specific examples"
- "Include supporting evidence"
- "Cite relevant sources"
- "Add concrete recommendations"

### Breadth Enhancement
- "Consider alternative approaches"
- "Evaluate from multiple angles"
- "Include edge cases"
- "Address constraints"
