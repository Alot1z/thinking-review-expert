# Logical Structure Checklist

## Purpose
Validate the logical structure, coherence, and cognitive architecture of thinking outputs.

## Sequential Thinking Validation

### Progressive Build Criteria
- [ ] Thoughts build progressively (each adds value)
- [ ] Clear advancement between thoughts
- [ ] No repetition without new insight
- [ ] Conclusions logically follow from premises
- [ ] Thought sequence tells coherent story

### Common Issues
- **P0**: Circular reasoning (thoughts loop without progress)
- **P1**: Non-sequitur (thoughts don't connect)
- **P2**: Repetitive (same points restated)
- **P3**: Minor progression (small incremental advances)

### Validation Prompts
```
- Does each thought add new value?
- Is there clear progression between thoughts?
- Do conclusions follow from premises?
- Is the thought sequence coherent?
```

## Tractatus Thinking Validation

### Atomic Decomposition Criteria
- [ ] Proper atomic decomposition achieved
- [ ] Fundamental components identified
- [ ] Logical structure complete
- [ ] Dependencies clearly mapped
- [ ] Indivisible elements found

### Common Issues
- **P0**: Invalid deductions (logical fallacies)
- **P1**: Incomplete decomposition (missing components)
- **P2**: Shallow structure (insufficient depth)
- **P3**: Missing connections (unrelated propositions)

### Validation Prompts
```
- Is the decomposition truly atomic?
- Are all fundamental components identified?
- Is the logical structure complete?
- Are dependencies clearly mapped?
```

## Debug Thinking Validation

### Problem Tracking Criteria
- [ ] Problems clearly defined
- [ ] Hypotheses properly formed
- [ ] Experiments designed to test
- [ ] Solutions documented
- [ ] Learning captured

### Common Issues
- **P0**: No problems tracked (debug thinking unused)
- **P1**: Problems not clearly defined
- **P2**: Hypotheses untestable
- **P3**: Learning not documented

### Validation Prompts
```
- What problems were identified?
- Were hypotheses testable?
- Were solutions validated?
- Was learning captured?
```

## Cross-Tool Integration

### Integration Quality Criteria
- [ ] Sequential insights inform Tractatus analysis
- [ ] Tractatus structure guides Debug tracking
- [ ] Debug findings validate Sequential conclusions
- [ ] All three tools create coherent whole
- [ ] Tool rotation follows T→S→D pattern

### Common Issues
- **P0**: Tools used independently (no integration)
- **P1**: Wrong tool rotation pattern
- **P2**: Weak connections between tool outputs
- **P3**: Tool sequence not optimized

### Validation Prompts
```
- Do insights flow between tools?
- Was correct T→S→D rotation used?
- Do tools complement each other?
- Is there coherent integration?
```

## Logical Coherence Score

Calculate coherence as:
```
Coherence = (Sequential × 0.3) + (Tractatus × 0.4) + (Debug × 0.3)
Where each tool scored 0-100 on its criteria

Target: 90+ overall coherence
```

## Common Logical Fallacies to Detect

### Formal Fallacies (P0)
- **Circular Reasoning**: Conclusion in premises
- **False Dilemma**: Only two options when more exist
- **Appeal to Authority**: Truth because expert said so
- **Ad Hominem**: Attack person not argument

### Informal Fallacies (P1)
- **Straw Man**: Misrepresenting argument
- **Slippery Slope**: Extreme consequences unlikely
- **Hasty Generalization**: Insufficient evidence
- **Red Herring**: Irrelevant distraction

### Cognitive Biases (P2)
- **Confirmation Bias**: Seeking confirming evidence
- **Anchoring Bias**: Overweighting first information
- **Availability Bias**: Overweighting recent examples
- **Sunk Cost Fallacy**: Continuing due to investment

## Quality Metrics

| Metric | Target | P0 | P1 | P2 | P3 |
|--------|--------|----|----|----|----|
| Progressive Build | 95%+ | <70% | 70-85% | 85-90% | 90-95% |
| Atomic Decomposition | Complete | Missing | Shallow | Partial | Minor |
| Problem Tracking | 5+ nodes | 0 | 1-2 | 3-4 | 5+ |
| Tool Integration | 90%+ | <60% | 60-80% | 80-85% | 85-90% |
| Logical Coherence | 90%+ | <70% | 70-85% | 85-90% | 90-95% |
